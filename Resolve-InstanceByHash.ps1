<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Resolves every jar ACTUALLY INSTALLED in the instance to its exact Modrinth
    version (by SHA1) or CurseForge file (by fingerprint) - reversing the
    direction of the old pipeline. Instead of trusting links_to_mods.txt and
    checking the folder against it, this treats the folder as ground truth and
    asks the platforms "which exact version IS this file?"

.DESCRIPTION
    Why this exists - two failure modes in the URL-driven approach:

    1. WRONG VERSION: when a Modrinth URL ends in a human-readable version
       NUMBER (e.g. /version/1.2.7.0-1.21.1) instead of an opaque version ID,
       resolution has to search the project's version list for a matching
       version_number. Modrinth projects routinely publish the SAME version
       number as separate versions per loader (fabric/forge/neoforge) and per
       MC version - so "first match" can silently be the wrong build. Hash
       lookup has no such ambiguity: one SHA1 -> one exact version.

    2. WRONG FILE (.zip vs .jar): datapack-category projects like Structory /
       Structory: Towers attach BOTH a datapack .zip and loader .jars to their
       releases (or mark the .zip as the "primary" file). Selecting the
       version's primary file returns the .zip even though the Modrinth App
       installed the NeoForge .jar. Hash lookup sidesteps this too: we select
       the file within the version whose sha1 EQUALS the local jar's sha1 -
       by construction that is the jar sitting in mods/.

    Pipeline:
      1. Load the inventory CSV (FileName + SHA1 per jar), or hash a mods
         folder live if no inventory is given.
      2. Batch POST all SHA1s to Modrinth /v2/version_files (100 per request)
         -> exact version + exact file for every Modrinth-sourced jar.
      3. Batch GET /v2/projects for slugs/titles of everything matched.
      4. For jars Modrinth doesn't know: compute CurseForge fingerprints
         (murmur2 seed=1 over the file with whitespace bytes stripped) and
         batch POST /v1/fingerprints/432 -> exact modId + fileId. Requires
         CF_API_KEY; skipped (with a warning) if absent.
      5. Whatever matches neither is reported UNMATCHED - expected for
         self-built jars (everythingores/everythingfood dev builds) and
         hand-patched files.

    Outputs:
      - <OutputCsv>: one row per jar with source, slug, exact version/file id,
        canonical URL, and whether the platform filename matches the local one.
      - <ResolvedLinksOut>: a regenerated links file (##Modrinth /
        ##Curseforge sections) with EXACT version-ID URLs - this becomes the
        new ground-truth links_to_mods.txt, replacing hand-collected links.
      - With -Apply -PackDir: writes/updates one .pw.toml per matched jar
        under <PackDir>\mods\. An existing entry (matched by Modrinth mod-id
        or CF project-id, same convention as Process-ModList.ps1) is updated
        in place with its 'side' preserved. CurseForge entries are written in
        packwiz's metadata mode (mode = "metadata:curseforge") so they work
        even when the author has disabled third-party API downloads.
      - With -LinksFile: a drift report comparing the old hand-collected links
        against what's actually installed (projects linked but not installed,
        installed but not linked, and Modrinth version-ID mismatches).

.PARAMETER InventoryCsv
    Path to mod-folder-inventory.csv from Get-ModFolderInventory.ps1
    (needs FileName + SHA1 columns). Preferred over live hashing.

.PARAMETER InstanceModsFolder
    Used to hash jars live when -InventoryCsv is omitted, and (always) to
    locate the physical files for CurseForge fingerprinting. If you pass only
    -InventoryCsv, fingerprinting reads paths from the CSV's FullPath column.

.PARAMETER LinksFile
    Optional. Old links_to_mods.txt to produce the drift report against.

.PARAMETER Apply / PackDir
    Write .pw.toml files into <PackDir>\mods (PackDir must contain pack.toml).

.PARAMETER SelfTest
    Verifies the embedded murmur2/fingerprint implementation against known
    vectors and exits. Run this once before trusting CF fingerprint results.

.PARAMETER TestCfKey
    Diagnoses the CurseForge API key (shape check + optional live probe against
    /v1/games/432) and exits without touching the mods folder. Use this when
    Phase 2 dies with a 401 - it tells you WHICH key was loaded, from where,
    and what is wrong with it, instead of failing 74 fingerprints later.
    The same shape check runs automatically on every normal run.

# ========================== CurseForge key diagnosis ==========================
# A CurseForge API key is a bcrypt-shaped string: a '$2a$10$' prefix plus 53
# characters = 60 total, containing EXACTLY three '$'. CF answers 401 for a
# missing OR malformed key and 403 for a valid-but-unauthorised/rate-limited
# one, so a 401 is always a statement about the literal bytes we sent - which
# is why checking the shape locally resolves this faster than any retry logic.
#
# The dominant failure is a MANGLED key, not an absent one, because '$' is the
# PowerShell interpolation sigil:
#     $env:CF_API_KEY = "$2a$10$IWDpXbn..."   -> $2a, $10, $IWDpXbn all expand
#                                                to empty; you store garbage
#     $env:CF_API_KEY = '$2a$10$IWDpXbn...'   -> correct (single quotes)
# The same applies to any script that WROTE secrets.local.env using double
# quotes, or an interpolating here-string instead of a literal one.
#
# Second most common: an inline comment or stray quote surviving the parse,
# since the secrets reader only skips lines that START with '#'.

# ============================== CF GOVERNOR ==============================
# CurseForge does not publish its rate limits. The community consensus is that
# they are low, that the reset window is unknown (an hour is the usual advice),
# and that what actually gets a key flagged is a process retrying in a tight
# loop after the first rejection. Some 403s are Cloudflare reacting to the IP
# rather than CurseForge reacting to the key.
#
# Because the ceiling is unknowable, this does NOT try to ride close to it.
# Five layers, cheapest first:
#
#   1. CACHE       A fingerprint is a content hash: fingerprint -> CF file is a
#                  permanent fact. Cache it on disk and a re-run costs zero
#                  requests. This is by far the biggest saving, since the
#                  workflow is "run the script repeatedly while iterating".
#                  Misses are cached too (a dev jar will never be on CF), with
#                  a TTL so a newly-published mod is eventually re-checked.
#   2. BATCHING    /v1/fingerprints takes 100 per call, /v1/mods takes 50.
#                  74 unmatched jars is ONE fingerprint call plus one or two
#                  mods calls. The budget below is enormous relative to need.
#   3. BUDGET      A ledger of request timestamps persisted ACROSS RUNS. In-
#                  process pacing is useless here: ten runs in ten minutes is
#                  the realistic pattern, and each would start with a clean
#                  counter. Rolling hour + rolling minute windows.
#   4. SPACING     Minimum interval between requests, with jitter, serial only.
#                  Never parallel.
#   5. BREAKER     On 429/403 the run does not retry into the wall. It records
#                  a cooldown timestamp in the ledger and every subsequent run
#                  refuses to touch CF until it expires. This is the layer that
#                  actually protects the key; the others just make it rare.
#
# 401 is deliberately NOT treated as throttling: it is a bad credential, not a
# transient condition, and backing off would only obscure it.
